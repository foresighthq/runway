## Reviews
“As a startup coach and repeat entrepreneur myself, I spend a lot of time in spreadsheets. The Foresight tools that I’ve used are easy to understand, modify, and, perhaps most importantly, the formulas are correct! Beyond the actual spreadsheets, Taylor is a wealth of knowledge and an incredibly quick communicator. He has gone above and beyond what I expected to deliver value.”
